There are a lot of unstyled web pages on my website, characteristically black Times New Roman text on a white background. I didn't bother adding CSS to them because I didn't think it was necessary, and I was lazy. Some examples of web pages that I use frequently are:

- [intense-contrast]
- [jpg-quality]
- [image-translucentifier]
- [svg-to-png]

But I'm pretty sure people, even non web devs, regard these pages as unfinished, suspicious, unprofessional, etc. and might outright refuse to use them even if they work and are adless.

For a while, I've been thinking of establishing a design/component library for my own use, and I think that will be what Reform will bring about.

A lot of "unstyled pages" listed below already do have a bit of style. The Reform program is mainly to get rid of Times New Roman, unless it's clear that the rest of the app has been graced with enough styling that the Times New Roman may be intentional (OlamREEE).

## Plan

I will introduce Reform in four stages:

1. Collect all unstyled pages across my website.
2. Figure out what these pages need to figure out what would best serve the web pages I create in the future.
3. Update all unstyled pages to adopt the new style system (Reform).
4. Write documentation and code samples so I can use Reform in new web pages.

Some features that Reform will have:

- An aqua gradient on the top to conform with the home page for a bit of site-wide identity.
  - The l'sxafeto design will also be adjusted just on the Reform pages. I think I will remove the circle and add the aqua gradient to the sheep outline.
- Support for light and dark theme using CSS variables. CSS variables are optimal because I may want to add a light/dark toggle in the future, but that's currently low priority.
- Improved user experience:
  - All pages will accept images via the clipboard.
  - Sliders will show the numerical value and allow you to edit the value directly.
  - Form fields will support more detailed labels.
- Improved developer experience:
  - I won't have to copy and paste the ugly code from [jpg-quality] every time I want to make a new web page that accepts an image.
- A CSS-powered (using `::after`) bubble that says "Loading..." then "JavaScript failed to run." if JavaScript does not add `.js-enabled` or something to `<body>` in time.

## Existing unstyled pages

I'll focus on interactive web pages first, but I've settled on about five Reform page layouts/templates:

- A single column form with form fields that immediately update the output, like [font-maker].
  - This is the most flexible in terms of responsive design, and most existing web pages are already like this.
- A sidebar with settings with an output image prominently taking up the rest of the screen, like [gif-caption].
  - I'm not sure if the sidebar layout is best, though. It gives little room for detailed labels.
- A two column textarea, where one side is the input and the other side is the output, like [encrypt].
- A directory page.
- A redirect page with a drawing of a sheep.
- A 404 page with a drawing of a sheep.

Common themes:

- Settings
  - Text fields tend to be input textareas
  - Number fields (sometimes integer-only)
  - Sliders
    - Sometimes used to select a time during playback (i.e. a scrubber)
  - Radios with descriptions
  - Dropdowns (which are basically radios but harder to style)
    - Dropdowns only make sense for long lists of options, like for TTS voice
- Inputs
  - Select file, paste image, textarea
    - A lot of them preview your input image next to the output.
    - Sometimes an input is also an output, using for encryption/decryption.
- Outputs (sometimes multiple): may want to provide a download/copy/share(?) button. Output should automatically recalculate when inputs change, but there can be an option to disable this.
  - Canvas/video
    - Canvas potentially interactive
  - Plain text/code (eg JSON)
  - Rich text
  - Table
  - Working/error log
  - Individual numerical values
- Buttons
  - Download file
  - Play button (often with stop/pause buttons)
  - Control panel (button group): multiple buttons with same hierarchy. It wouldn't make sense for any one of them to be a primary button. They could be shown as a ribbon of adjacent buttons, like in iOS.
- Instructions, about
- Sometimes short inputs or outputs are given a large fonts

## Design

Reform will be driven by inputs and outputs. Each output will independently specify the inputs that it depends on, then it'll be given an object mapping IDs to the input's value, casted to the appropriate type. It might look something like:

```html
<input type="text" id="message" />
<input type="number" id="length" />
<div id="cropped" data-inputs="message length"></div>
```

```js
output('cropped', (elem, { message, length }) => {
  elem.textContent = message.slice(0, length)
})
```

The callback function will be called every time one of the specified inputs change.

### Study: How to translate [intense-contrast]

Much of the HTML would remain the same, including the radios' fieldset. For each radio, however, I'd split the description:

> - **Lightened**
>
>   Like primitive, but a square root function is applied to make differences in dark pixels more obvious by making the pixels lighter.

```html
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="method" value="lightened" />
  <div class="label">
    <p class="label-primary">Lightened</p>
    <p class="label-secondary">
      Like primitive, but a square root function is applied to make differences
      in dark pixels more obvious by making the pixels lighter.
    </p>
  </div>
</label>
```

**NOTE**: MDN says [not to put links in labels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label#accessibility_concerns). Instead, move the links outside:

```html
<!-- ❌ -->
<label>
  <p class="label-primary">Full name</p>
  <p class="label-secondary">
    Letters only, no hyphens. If your name is in Chinese, use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Hanyu pinyin</a>.
  </p>
  <input type="text" id="name" />
</label>

<!-- ⭕ -->
<label>
  <p class="label-primary">Full name</p>
  <p class="label-secondary">Letters only, no hyphens.</p>
  <input type="text" id="name" />
</label>
<p>
  If your name is in Chinese, use
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Hanyu pinyin</a>.
</p>
```

**NOTE**: Don't use [placeholders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#placeholder).

**NOTE**: Don't use [number inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#accessibility). (Use `inputmode="numeric"` and `pattern` instead.)

---

The most interesting thing about [intense-contrast], though, is that it has an additional input in the form of a pointer-selected region.

```html
<div id="selectionArea" data-inputs="preview">
  <canvas id="preview"></canvas>
  <canvas id="contrast" data-inputs="method image selectionArea"></canvas>
</div>
```

`#preview` contains the input image. I will treat `#selectionArea` as a custom input, so `#contrast` is an output that depends on `method` (the radio buttons), `#image` (the selected image), and the custom input. Note that these IDs are camelCase for convenience when working in JS.

I think to create custom inputs, you can register them using a function `input`. To get a reference to `#preview`, I've added `preview` as an input/dependency of `#selectionArea` in the HTML. I might rename `data-inputs` to `data-deps` (and `input` to `dep`?), actually.

```js
input('selectionArea', (elem, setValue, { preview }) => {
  // Initialize input
  let regionSetter
  // ...
  const handlePointerEnd = e => {
    if (regionSetter?.pointer === e.pointerId) {
      if (regionSetter.dragging) {
        setValue([regionSetter.minX, regionSetter.minY])
      }
      regionSetter = null
    }
  }
  elem.addEventListener('pointerup', handlePointerEnd)
  elem.addEventListener('pointercancel', handlePointerEnd)
  // Default value
  return [0, 0]
})
```

---

Finally, how about selecting the image? For files, I want to allow many ways to accept files:

- Clicking on the choose file button
- Dropping a file onto the choose file button/the web page
- Pasting

I think dropping anywhere and pasting will only be enabled if a file input is marked as "main" or something. For example,

```html
<label>
  <p>Target image</p>
  <input type="file" id="image" accept="image/*" data-main />
</label>
```

The markup I use for file inputs is important, though. It's possible that I will want to use the `<label>` as the "choose file" button, in which case, if I want to show a focus ring around it, I'll have to move the `<input>` element outside so I can use the sibling selector:

```html
<input type="file" id="image" accept="image/*" data-main />
<label for="image"><span>Choose target image</span></label>
```

The `<label>` element can be a large-ish drop area, while the `<span>` can be the fake button that receives the focus ring. Then, to immediately show the selected image, I could do

```html
<canvas data-preview="image"></canvas>
```

In JavaScript, I guess I could just find all elements with the `[data-preview]` attribute (I considered adding a new class, but I think the performance difference between finding elements by attribute vs class is significant).

### Study: [delegalifier]

_I've decided to make `[data-main]` a class and rename `input` to `dep`._

I think many input-output relationships will be done with two textareas/images next to each other, and this can take up the full width of the screen. With a special class on `<body>`, these can take up the entire height of the screen, but this is opt-in if there are multiple input-output relationships.

For [delegalifier], the HTML could look something like this:

```html
<body class="fullscreen-2col">
  <header>
    <h1>legalese informalifier</h1>
  </header>
  <main class="2col">
    <div class="input">
      <input type="file" id="file" accept="image/*" class="accessible main" />
      <label class="file-input" for="image">
        <span class="upload-btn">
          <span class="icon icon-upload"></span>
          Choose
        </span>
        <span class="hint">or drop/paste a file.</span>
        <span class="selected">unknown.txt (100 kB)</span>
      </label>
      <textarea id="input" data-deps="file"></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <textarea id="output" data-deps="input"></textarea>
      <div class="output-btns">
        <button class="output-btn download-btn" data-output="output">
          <span class="icon icon-download"></span>
          <span class="rhs">
            <span class="btn-text">Download</span>
            <span class="download-name">encrypted.txt (50 kB)</span>
          </span>
        </button>
        <button
          class="output-btn copy-btn"
          data-output="output"
          aria-label="Copy"
        >
          <span class="icon icon-copy"></span>
        </button>
        <button
          class="output-btn share-btn"
          data-output="output"
          aria-label="Share"
        >
          <span class="icon icon-share"></span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </main>
</body>
```

- `.fullscreen-2col` sets up a 2-column layout. `<main>` will be `flex: auto`, taking up the height of the page.
- `.2col` (which would normally applied to a `<div>` in a normal one-column layout) puts its two children side-by-side. On mobile, the `flex-direction` will change to `column`, so the input shows on top of the output.
- `.input` has `flex-direction: column-reverse` for desktop so that the file input shows _below_ the input textarea. This is not the greatest practice because the tab order disagrees with the visual order, but it aligns the file input with the output buttons on the bottom, and it also places the input and output textareas next to each other in the tab order and on mobile.
- `.accessible` is a helper class to make the file input accessible but hidden.
- `.main` indicates that the file input is the main input, so pasting or dropping anywhere will insert the file into `#image`.
- `.file-input` is a wrapper that draws a drop zone rectangle.
- `#input` has `data-deps="file"` so that when the user uploads a file, it updates `#input`.

  I think that if any one of `#input`'s dependencies updates, it assumes that `#input` updates too, even if it doesn't actually change, and so it'll update its dependents regardless. This way, the handler for `#input` doesn't have to worry about calling some callback function whenever it changes value.

- The `.output-btn[aria-label]`s are icon buttons. Some CSS will be used to show a tooltip (using a pseudo-element with `content: attr(aria-label)`) on hover/focus.

There are several options for icons:

- Using an icon font is a no-go from me because it loads a lot of other resources I don't need.
- Using an SVG background image would be the easiest (requires least markup), but it would make it harder to adapt between light and dark mode (requires a lot of CSS).
- Inserting an SVG element is nice because CSS can interface with it directly. This not only allows me to set the icon color to `currentColor`, but it also lets me add some cool stroke animations as well.
  - I could include the SVG in the HTML, but this would make the HTML verbose, and it would make it harder to change the icon design in the future.
  - I could add the SVG via JavaScript, but this wouldn't show if JavaScript is disabled, and it would take some time for the icons to show.

I think I will go for the JavaScript solution for now, which I could replace with the background image approach later on if I want to.

---

Actually, I think everything should be inside a form. Form elements have nice features like `form.elements`, which is an object mapping `name`s to input elements or a list of radios, and `form.elements.radio.value` gives the selected radio value. For single-line inputs, pressing enter also submits the form.

```html
<body class="fullscreen-2col">
  <form id="main">
    <header>
      <h1>legalese informalifier</h1>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="auto" checked />
        Convert as you type
      </label>
      <button>Informalify</button>
    </header>
    <!-- ... -->
  </form>
</body>
```

`#main` is a special ID name that the script uses to get the form that the entire interface sits under. There can only be one form per page.

Then, instead of using `id`, we can use `name` for form elements. For custom inputs, I guess they'll still have to use `id` because `<canvas>`es can't have `name`.

I'm not sure whether to include the auto-evaluate checkbox and button since it adds a lot of extra noise, at least to the 2-column layout.

## Implementation notes

Apparently you aren't supposed to have `<p>` tags inside a `<label>`.

I don't like how having `<body>`, `<main>`, and `<form>` results in so many nested levels of indentation. I think I will omit `<main>` unless there's a `<div>` that it can replace.

I will also prefix classes with JavaScript significance with `reform:` so I don't remove them if they don't get CSS. Though, it's probably best if I give a class to everything so it's easier to style in the future.

Apparently, `<label>`s' `[for]` takes an `[id]` and doesn't accept `[name]`s, which complicates file inputs. I think I will make file inputs ID-only as well.

## Documentation

- All inputs with a `name` attribute are sources
- Any element with a `name` or `id` attribute and a `data-deps` attribute can be selected using `on` to define a custom source or listener on its dependencies.
  - Return a value in the callback to make it a custom source
  - If `output-controls` is available as a sibling, then return a `File` to populate the download/copy/share buttons
- `reform:io` defines a fancy file input. Use `reform:image-input` on a file input to preview an image in a `<canvas>`, or `reform:text-input` to preview text in a `<textarea>`. You can optionally add `reform:paste-target` to make it listen to global `paste` events.
  - `reform:image-input` makes the file input a source of `<canvas>` elements with `data-name` set to the file name, without the file extension
  - `reform:text-input` makes the textarea a source of string values
